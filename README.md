# bash_shell
Emulated bash shell in C. Operating Systems Concepts, Spring 2018.
This shell's functionality is limited to changing directories (cd), listing a history of commands, and exiting the shell. 
Most other basic bash shell commands are simply executed by the main shell, but cd and history are implemented by this code.
